I made it, after a long and confusing walk through the Flughafen!
I decided to go to Berlin for vacation and now I'm finally here.
My friends and I are going to eat Bratwurst!
And When we are finished, we will drive our Porsche to Berlin.
I felt some hunger pains and decided to stop for brot.
I could smell the Baeckerei as soon as I pulled up!
On my way there I saw a gigantic Schloss!
Inside there was a large Hund.
I felt like it was time to enjoy a delicious hot Apfelkuchen!
